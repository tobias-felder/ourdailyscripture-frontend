## Week 1: The Problem - Sin, Wrath, and Universal Guilt (Romans 1-3)

### Key Scripture Passages

-   **Romans 1:16-17:** The theme of the book—the righteousness of God revealed in the Gospel.
-   **Romans 1:18-25:** The suppression of truth and the wrath of God against ungodliness.
-   **Romans 2:1-11:** The warning against judging others, as all are guilty before God.
-   **Romans 3:23:** The universal verdict: "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

### Deep Dive Teaching

Paul begins his letter by establishing a crucial and uncomfortable truth: every single human being, without exception, is under the power of sin and deserving of God’s wrath. He systematically deconstructs any basis for human pride or self-righteousness.

-   **The Gentile World (Chapter 1):** Paul shows how those without the law of God (the Gentiles) are still without excuse. They can see God’s power and divine nature clearly in creation, yet they have suppressed this truth, exchanged the worship of the Creator for the worship of created things, and been given over to the consequences of their sin.
-   **The Jewish World (Chapter 2):** Paul then turns to the religious and moral person (represented by the Jews), who might feel superior. He argues that having the law and judging others does not make one righteous. In fact, it increases their culpability, because they do not perfectly obey the law they claim to have. God judges impartially, based on what is in the heart.
-   **The Universal Conclusion (Chapter 3):** Paul brings it all together with a series of Old Testament quotes to prove his point: "There is no one righteous, not even one" (Romans 3:10). The entire world, both religious and irreligious, is held accountable to God. The law’s purpose was not to save, but to make us conscious of our sin.

The conclusion of this section is bleak but necessary. It is the bad news that makes the good news so glorious. We are all hopelessly lost in our sin and unable to save ourselves.

### Discussion Questions

1.  Why must we understand the bad news of sin and wrath before we can truly appreciate the good news of the Gospel?
2.  How does Romans 1:20 ("For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities... have been clearly seen") challenge the idea that someone has never had a chance to know God?
3.  In what ways do we, like the people described in Romans 2, sometimes judge others for the same sins we ourselves commit?
4.  Discuss Romans 3:23. What does it mean to "fall short of the glory of God"?

## Week 2: The Solution - Justification by Faith (Romans 3-5)

### Key Scripture Passages

-   **Romans 3:21-26:** The heart of the Gospel—justification by faith in Jesus Christ.
-   **Romans 4:1-5, 16-25:** The example of Abraham, who was justified by faith, not works.
-   **Romans 5:1-2:** The results of justification: peace with God and access to grace.
-   **Romans 5:8:** The ultimate demonstration of God’s love: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

### Deep Dive Teaching

Just when the situation seems hopeless, Paul makes a dramatic turn: "But now..." (Romans 3:21). He introduces the glorious solution to our sin problem: **justification by faith.**

**Justification** is a legal term. It means to be declared righteous. It is not about *becoming* righteous in our behavior (that is sanctification, which comes later); it is about being *declared* righteous in our legal standing before God. This happens the moment we put our faith in Jesus.

-   **The Basis of Justification:** Our justification is based entirely on the work of Christ. He lived a perfect life and died a substitutionary death on the cross, taking the punishment for our sin. God’s justice was satisfied. This is the concept of **propitiation** (Romans 3:25).
-   **The Means of Justification:** We receive this justification not by our works, but "through faith in Jesus Christ" (Romans 3:22). Faith is the empty hand that receives the free gift of God’s grace. Paul uses Abraham, the father of the Jewish faith, as his prime example (Chapter 4). Abraham was declared righteous long before he was circumcised or had done any great works, simply because he "believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."
-   **The Results of Justification:** The immediate result is peace with God (Romans 5:1). The hostility caused by our sin is removed. We are no longer enemies of God, but His children. We have access to His grace and can rejoice in the hope of His glory.

### Discussion Questions

1.  Explain the concept of justification in your own words. Why is it so important that it is a legal declaration from God?
2.  Why was it necessary for Paul to use Abraham as an example in Chapter 4?
3.  Read Romans 5:8. Why is it so significant that Christ died for us "while we were still sinners"?
4.  What is the difference between having peace *with* God (Romans 5:1) and having the peace *of* God (Philippians 4:7)?

## Week 3: The New Life - Freedom from Sin and Life in the Spirit (Romans 6-8)

### Key Scripture Passages

-   **Romans 6:1-4, 11-14:** Dead to sin, alive in Christ. We are no longer slaves to sin.
-   **Romans 7:15-25:** The struggle with indwelling sin. The cry of a believer who desires to do good but still battles the flesh.
-   **Romans 8:1-2:** The glorious verdict: "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
-   **Romans 8:28, 38-39:** The unbreakable security of the believer. God works all things for our good, and nothing can separate us from His love.

### Deep Dive Teaching

If we are saved by grace, does that mean we can keep on sinning? Paul addresses this question head-on in Chapter 6. His answer is an emphatic "By no means!" He explains that through our union with Christ in baptism, we have died to our old life of sin. Sin is no longer our master; we are now slaves to righteousness.

However, this doesn't mean the struggle is over. In Chapter 7, Paul describes the intense inner conflict that every believer experiences—the war between our new nature that desires to obey God and the remnants of our old sinful flesh. This is a realistic and relatable description of the Christian life.

Chapter 8 is the triumphant climax. It is the answer to the struggle of Chapter 7. The solution is life in the Holy Spirit. The Spirit empowers us to overcome sin, assures us that we are God's children, helps us in our weakness, and intercedes for us in prayer. The chapter begins with "no condemnation" and ends with "no separation." It is one of the most powerful chapters in the entire Bible on the security and hope of the believer.

### Discussion Questions

1.  How would you answer someone who says, "If I'm saved by grace, I can live however I want"?
2.  Does Paul's description of his struggle in Romans 7:15-25 encourage or discourage you? Why?
3.  What is the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life, according to Romans 8?
4.  Read Romans 8:38-39 aloud. How does this absolute assurance of God's love impact the way you face fear, doubt, and failure?

## Week 4: The Practical Application - Living Out the Gospel (Romans 12-15)

### Key Scripture Passages

-   **Romans 12:1-2:** The call to present our bodies as living sacrifices and to be transformed by the renewing of our minds.
-   **Romans 12:3-8:** Using our spiritual gifts to serve the body of Christ.
-   **Romans 12:9-21:** Marks of a true Christian—love, hospitality, forgiveness, overcoming evil with good.
-   **Romans 13:1-7:** Submission to governing authorities.
-   **Romans 14:1-13:** Dealing with disputable matters and not judging our brothers and sisters in Christ.

### Deep Dive Teaching

After 11 chapters of deep theology, Paul turns to the practical application. The word "therefore" in Romans 12:1 is crucial. *Because of* everything God has done for us (Chapters 1-11), our only logical response is to offer our entire lives back to Him in worship.

This worship is not a Sunday morning activity; it is a 24/7 lifestyle. It involves:

-   **Transformation, not Conformation:** We are not to be conformed to the pattern of this world, but to be transformed from the inside out by the renewing of our minds through God's Word.
-   **Serving the Church:** We are to use the spiritual gifts God has given us to build up the body of Christ, recognizing that we are all interconnected and dependent on one another.
-   **Loving Others:** Paul gives a rapid-fire list of what authentic Christian love looks like in action: it is sincere, it honors others, it is patient, it is generous, it blesses those who persecute it.
-   **Relating to the World:** We are to submit to the authorities God has placed over us and live as good citizens.
-   **Relating to Other Christians:** On non-essential, "disputable" matters (like diet or special days), we are not to judge or look down on one another. We are to live in a way that builds others up, always remembering that we are all accountable to the Lord.

### Discussion Questions

1.  What does it mean to be a "living sacrifice"? How is this different from the Old Testament sacrifices?
2.  According to Romans 12, what are some practical ways we can avoid being "conformed to the pattern of this world"?
3.  Which of the marks of a true Christian in Romans 12:9-21 do you find most challenging to live out?
4.  How can the principles in Romans 14 help the church maintain unity despite differing opinions on non-essential issues?
