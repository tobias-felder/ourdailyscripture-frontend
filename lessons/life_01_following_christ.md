# Following Christ Daily: A Study on Discipleship

**Category:** Life-Application Study

---

## Introduction

What does it truly mean to be a Christian? Is it a one-time decision, a weekly church attendance, or a cultural identity? The Bible presents a picture of Christianity that is far more radical and all-encompassing: it is a call to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. The word "disciple" literally means "learner" or "apprentice." A disciple is someone who has decided to orient their entire life around the person and teachings of Jesus, learning from Him, obeying Him, and becoming more like Him.

This study will explore the practical, day-to-day realities of what it means to follow Christ. We will move beyond the abstract and into the concrete, examining the call to discipleship, the cost of discipleship, and the transformative practices that help us grow as followers of Jesus. This is not about a checklist of religious duties, but about a dynamic, life-giving relationship with the living Christ that changes everything.

## Deep Dive Teaching

### The Call to Follow

Jesus’ ministry began with a simple but profound invitation: "Follow me." When He called the first disciples—Peter, Andrew, James, and John—they were in the middle of their workday. The call was an invitation to leave their old lives behind and to embark on a new adventure with Him. They left their nets, their boats, and their families to follow an itinerant teacher who promised them nothing in terms of worldly security, but everything in terms of eternal significance. He promised to make them "fishers of men."

This call is extended to us today. To be a Christian is to answer this same call. It is a call to reorient our entire lives around Jesus. He becomes our Lord, our teacher, our guide, and our greatest treasure. Our careers, our relationships, our finances, and our ambitions are all brought under His authority.

### The Cost of Following

Jesus was always honest about the cost of discipleship. He never tried to attract followers with false promises of an easy life. In Luke 9:23, He lays out the non-negotiable terms: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me." Let’s break this down:

-   **Deny Themselves:** This is a call to dethrone the self. It means saying "no" to our own selfish desires, our pride, our ego, and our sinful inclinations, and saying "yes" to God’s will. It is a radical shift from a self-centered life to a Christ-centered life.
-   **Take Up Their Cross Daily:** The cross was an instrument of execution. For a first-century listener, this was a shocking image. It meant being willing to die—to die to our old way of life, to die to our own ambitions, and, in some cases, to literally die for our faith. The word "daily" emphasizes that this is not a one-time act, but a continuous, moment-by-moment posture of surrender.
-   **Follow Me:** This is the positive action. We are not just dying to something; we are living for Someone. We follow Jesus, learning His ways, obeying His commands, and walking in His footsteps.

### The Practices of Following

How do we practically live out this life of discipleship? Jesus gives us several key practices:

-   **Abiding in the Word (John 8:31-32):** A disciple is a learner. We learn about Jesus and His will for our lives by consistently engaging with the Bible. This is not just academic study, but a relational encounter where we allow God’s Word to shape our thinking, our character, and our actions. Jesus says that if we abide in His word, we will know the truth, and the truth will set us free.
-   **Abiding in Christ through Prayer (John 15:1-8):** Jesus uses the metaphor of a vine and branches to describe our relationship with Him. A branch can only bear fruit if it remains connected to the vine. In the same way, we can only live a fruitful Christian life if we remain connected to Jesus. Prayer is a primary means of this connection. It is our lifeline, where we communicate with God, receive His strength, and align our hearts with His.
-   **Loving One Another (John 13:34-35):** Jesus gives His disciples a "new command": to love one another as He has loved them. He says that this mutual love will be the primary identifying mark of His followers to the watching world. Discipleship is not a solo journey; it is lived out in the context of a loving, supportive, and accountable community—the church.
-   **Making Disciples (Matthew 28:18-20):** The final command Jesus gave His disciples was to go and make more disciples. The process is cyclical. As we follow Jesus, we are called to help others follow Him. Our faith is meant to be multiplied. We do this by sharing the good news of Jesus (evangelism) and by teaching others to obey His commands (discipleship).

## Discussion Questions

1.  What is the difference between being a "Christian" in a cultural sense and being a "disciple" of Jesus?

2.  What did the first disciples have to leave behind to follow Jesus? What might we have to "leave behind" today?

3.  What does it mean to "deny yourself" and "take up your cross daily" in the 21st century? Can you think of a practical example from your own life?

4.  Why is abiding in God’s Word so essential for a disciple? How can we move from just reading the Bible to truly "abiding" in it?

5.  Jesus said the world would know we are His disciples by our love for one another. How well do you think the modern church is doing at fulfilling this?

6.  The Great Commission is a command to "make disciples," not just "make converts." What is the difference?

## Practical Application

1.  **Daily Surrender:** Start each day this week with a simple prayer of surrender: "Lord, today I deny myself, take up my cross, and follow you. Not my will, but yours be done." Pay attention to the small moments throughout the day where you have an opportunity to say "no" to self and "yes" to God.

2.  **Establish a "Keystone Habit":** Choose one of the key practices of discipleship (Bible intake or prayer) and commit to a small, consistent habit for the next 30 days. For example: read one chapter of the Gospel of John each day, or spend 10 minutes in focused prayer each morning. A small, consistent habit can lead to massive spiritual growth over time.

3.  **Invest in Community:** Make a specific effort this week to practice the "one another" commands of Scripture. Send an encouraging text to a fellow believer, invite someone over for a meal, or ask someone how you can be praying for them. Take a step to intentionally build the kind of loving community that Jesus commanded.

## Prayer Focus

*Lord Jesus, you have called me to be your disciple, not just a casual admirer. Forgive me for the times I have tried to follow you on my own terms. Today, I recommit my life to you. I choose to deny myself, take up my cross, and follow you. Teach me to abide in your Word and to remain connected to you through prayer. Fill me with your love so that I can love my brothers and sisters as you have loved me. Empower me to be a disciple who makes disciples. Thank you for the privilege of following you. Amen.*
