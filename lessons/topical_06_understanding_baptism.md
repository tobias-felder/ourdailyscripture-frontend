# Understanding Baptism: A Study of Romans 6 and the Great Commission

**Category:** Topical Lesson

---

## Introduction

Baptism is one of the most significant and symbolic acts in the Christian faith. It is a public declaration of a personal decision to follow Jesus Christ. However, there can be much confusion surrounding baptism: What does it mean? Is it necessary for salvation? Who should be baptized? How should it be done?

This lesson explores the biblical foundations of baptism, focusing on its meaning as described by the Apostle Paul in Romans 6 and its mandate as given by Jesus in the Great Commission. We will see that baptism is not a magic ritual that saves us, but rather a beautiful and powerful outward symbol of an inward transformation. It is a believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and a public testimony to the world that we have been made new.

## Deep Dive Teaching

### The Command: The Great Commission

Jesus' final instructions to His disciples before ascending to heaven are known as the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20). In this foundational command, He links the process of making disciples with two key actions: **baptizing** them and **teaching** them. Baptism is not presented as an optional add-on for the super-spiritual; it is a core component of discipleship. It is the first step of obedience after a person decides to follow Christ.

### The Meaning: Buried and Raised with Christ

Romans 6:3-4 provides the richest theological explanation of baptism's meaning. Paul uses the powerful imagery of death, burial, and resurrection to illustrate the spiritual reality that baptism represents.

-   **Baptized into His Death:** When a believer is immersed in the water, it symbolizes their death to their old life of sin. We are identifying with Christ's death on the cross, acknowledging that our old self has been crucified with Him.
-   **Buried with Him:** The moment of being underwater represents burial. Just as Christ was buried in the tomb, we are burying our old sinful nature, our past, and our former way of life.
-   **Raised to a New Life:** Emerging from the water is a picture of resurrection. Just as Christ was raised from the dead to a new, glorious life, we are raised to walk in a "new life." We are no longer slaves to sin but are alive to God in Christ Jesus.

Colossians 2:12 and Galatians 3:27 reinforce this. We are "clothed with Christ," taking on His identity. Baptism is our public wedding ring, showing the world that we belong to Him.

### The Prerequisite: Repentance and Faith

Throughout the book of Acts, we see a clear pattern: people hear the Gospel, they believe and repent, and then they are baptized. In Acts 2:38, Peter's call to the crowd on the day of Pentecost was to "Repent and be baptized." In Acts 8, the Ethiopian eunuch hears the good news about Jesus from Philip, believes, and then asks, "Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?" (Acts 8:36).

Faith in Christ is the prerequisite for baptism. This is why baptism is for believers, not for infants who cannot yet make a personal decision to follow Christ. It is a response to the grace we have already received through faith.

### Is Baptism Necessary for Salvation?

This is a common and important question. The Bible is clear that we are saved by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). Baptism is a work—an act of obedience. It is not the act of baptism that saves us, but the faith that it represents. The thief on the cross next to Jesus was saved without being baptized (Luke 23:42-43). However, while baptism is not a *requirement* for salvation, it is a *command* for every believer. A genuine, saving faith will naturally lead to a desire to obey Christ's command to be baptized.

## Discussion Questions

1.  Why do you think Jesus made baptism a central part of the Great Commission?

2.  How does the imagery in Romans 6 (death, burial, resurrection) help you understand the significance of baptism in a deeper way?

3.  Share your own baptism experience. If you haven't been baptized, what questions or hesitations do you have?

4.  What would you say to a new believer who asks, "Do I have to be baptized to be a Christian?"

5.  How can a believer continue to "live a new life" (Romans 6:4) long after their baptism? What does that look like on a daily basis?

6.  Baptism is a public declaration. Why is the public aspect of this ordinance important? What message does it send to the church, to the world, and to the spiritual realm?

## Practical Application

1.  **Get Baptized:** If you are a follower of Jesus but have never been baptized as a believer, the most important application of this lesson is to take that step of obedience. Talk to a pastor or leader at your church about getting baptized.

2.  **Remember Your Baptism:** If you have been baptized, take some time this week to reflect on that day. Look at pictures or videos if you have them. Thank God for the new life He has given you. Write down what has changed in your life since you decided to follow Christ and were buried and raised with Him.

3.  **Witness a Baptism:** Make an effort to attend a baptism service at your church. As you watch others take this step, pray for them and celebrate the work that God is doing in their lives. Let it be a powerful reminder of your own commitment and the beauty of the Gospel.

## Prayer Focus

*Father, thank you for the beautiful picture of baptism. Thank you for allowing me to be identified with the death, burial, and resurrection of your Son, Jesus. I praise you for the new life I have in Him. If I have not yet taken the step of baptism, give me the courage and clarity to obey your command. If I have been baptized, help me to live out the reality of my new life each and every day. Help me to die to sin and to live for righteousness. May my life be a constant testimony to the transforming power of the Gospel. In Jesus' name, Amen.*
