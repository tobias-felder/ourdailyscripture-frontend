# Biblical Money Management & Stewardship: A Study of Proverbs and the Parable of the Talents

**Category:** Topical Lesson

---

## Introduction

Money is a significant part of our daily lives, and the Bible has a great deal to say about it. In fact, there are over 2,000 verses in Scripture that address money, wealth, and possessions. This is not because God is obsessed with money, but because He knows how easily money can become an idol that captures our hearts and distracts us from our true purpose.

Biblical money management is not about getting rich; it is about stewardship. Stewardship is the understanding that everything we have—our time, our talents, and our treasures—ultimately belongs to God. We are simply managers, or stewards, entrusted with His resources. This lesson explores the practical wisdom of Proverbs and the profound principles of the Parable of the Talents to help us develop a biblical perspective on money, honor God with our finances, and invest in things of eternal value.

## Deep Dive Teaching

### The Foundation: It All Belongs to God

The starting point for biblical finance is ownership. Psalm 24:1 states, "The earth is the LORD’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it." Until we settle the issue of ownership, we will always struggle with money. When we acknowledge that God is the owner and we are the managers, our perspective shifts from "How much of my money should I give to God?" to "How much of God's money should I keep for myself?"

### The First Step: The Tithe (Firstfruits)

Proverbs 3:9 commands us to "Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops." The "firstfruits" principle, also known as the tithe (which means a tenth), is about giving God the first and best part of our income, not the leftovers. This is an act of worship and trust, demonstrating that we believe God is our source and that we are putting Him first in our lives. Malachi 3:10 contains the only instance in Scripture where God invites us to "test" Him, promising blessing for our faithfulness in tithing.

### The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30)

This parable provides a powerful framework for stewardship:

-   **The Master's Trust:** A master entrusts his wealth (talents) to three servants "each according to his ability." This shows that God has entrusted us with resources and expects us to manage them wisely.
-   **The Faithful Servants:** The servants with five and two talents immediately put the money to work and doubled it. They were diligent, took calculated risks, and produced a return for the master.
-   **The Wicked Servant:** The servant with one talent was driven by fear. He dug a hole and hid the money. He did not lose it, but he also did not grow it. His inaction was condemned.
-   **The Master's Reward:** The faithful servants were praised ("Well done, good and faithful servant!") and given more responsibility. The wicked servant had his talent taken away and was cast out.

The core message is that God expects a return on His investment. He has given us resources not to be hoarded or hidden, but to be used for His glory and the advancement of His kingdom. This applies not just to money, but to our skills, time, and opportunities.

### Practical Wisdom from Proverbs

Proverbs is filled with practical financial advice:

-   **Avoid Debt:** "The borrower is slave to the lender" (Proverbs 22:7). The Bible strongly cautions against the bondage of debt. A key goal of biblical stewardship is to become debt-free.
-   **Work Hard:** "Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth" (Proverbs 10:4).
-   **Save and Plan:** "A good person leaves an inheritance for their children’s children" (Proverbs 13:22). This requires foresight, planning, and saving.
-   **Diversify:** "Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight; you do not know what disaster may come upon the land" (Ecclesiastes 11:2).

## Discussion Questions

1.  How does the concept of stewardship (we are managers, not owners) change your personal approach to money and possessions?

2.  Discuss the principle of the tithe or "firstfruits." Why do you think giving God the *first* part is so important, as opposed to giving from what is left over?

3.  In the Parable of the Talents, the third servant was condemned not for losing the money, but for doing nothing with it. What does this teach us about God's expectation for the resources He gives us?

4.  Read 1 Timothy 6:10. Notice that it is the *love* of money, not money itself, that is the root of evil. What is the difference? How can we have and manage money without loving it?

5.  Proverbs 22:7 says the borrower is slave to the lender. Do you agree with this? Share any personal experiences with the stress or freedom related to debt.

6.  How can we be "cheerful givers" (2 Corinthians 9:7) in a world with so many financial pressures? What practical steps can help cultivate a spirit of generosity?

## Practical Application

1.  **Create a Budget (Spending Plan):** You can't manage what you don't measure. For one month, track all of your income and expenses. Then, create a budget based on biblical principles: Give first, Save second, Live on the rest. There are many great apps and tools to help with this (e.g., YNAB, Mint, EveryDollar).

2.  **The Tithe Challenge:** If you are not currently tithing, consider taking the Malachi 3:10 challenge. For the next 90 days, commit to giving the first 10% of your income to your local church or a ministry you believe in. See how God proves Himself faithful.

3.  **Debt Snowball/Avalanche:** If you have debt, create a plan to pay it off. List all your debts from smallest to largest (snowball method) or from highest interest rate to lowest (avalanche method). Make minimum payments on all but one, and attack that one with as much extra money as you can. Once it's paid off, roll that payment into the next one.

## Prayer Focus

*Lord, I acknowledge that everything I have comes from you. You are the owner, and I am your steward. Forgive me for the times I have been driven by greed, fear, or envy in my financial life. Help me to trust you as my provider and to put you first in my finances. Give me the wisdom to manage your resources well, the discipline to avoid debt, the diligence to work hard, and the generosity to give cheerfully. I want to be a good and faithful servant who hears "Well done" from you. May my financial life bring glory and honor to your name. In Jesus' name, Amen.*
