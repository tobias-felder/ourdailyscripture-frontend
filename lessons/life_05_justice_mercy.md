## Living Justice & Loving Mercy: A Bible Study

### Introduction

In a world grappling with inequality, injustice, and social division, the biblical call to "do justice and love mercy" is more relevant than ever. This lesson explores the heart of God's desire for His people to be agents of justice and compassion in their communities and beyond. We will examine what it truly means to live out the command found in Micah 6:8, moving beyond mere sentiment to active, transformative faith.

### Key Scripture Passages

1.  **Micah 6:8 (NIV):** "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."
2.  **Isaiah 1:17 (NIV):** "Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow."
3.  **Zechariah 7:9-10 (NIV):** "This is what the LORD Almighty said: 'Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.'"
4.  **Matthew 23:23 (NIV):** "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former."
5.  **James 1:27 (NIV):** "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."
6.  **Proverbs 31:8-9 (NIV):** "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy."

### Deep Dive Teaching

The prophet Micah encapsulates the essence of a God-honoring life in one powerful verse: act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly. These are not three separate commands but three interwoven facets of a single, righteous life. Justice, in the biblical sense, is not merely about punishment but about restoring wholeness and righteousness to a broken world. It involves defending the vulnerable, correcting oppression, and creating a society where all can flourish.

Jesus himself condemned the religious leaders of his day for their meticulous tithing while neglecting the "more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness" (Matthew 23:23). This demonstrates that our vertical relationship with God (walking humbly) is inseparable from our horizontal relationships with others (acting justly and loving mercy). True worship is not confined to religious rituals; it is expressed in compassionate action and a commitment to justice for the marginalized.

### Discussion Questions

1.  What does it mean to "act justly" in your daily life? Can you think of specific examples?
2.  How is "loving mercy" different from simply "being merciful"? What does the word "love" add to this command?
3.  Why do you think God places such a strong emphasis on caring for widows, orphans, and foreigners?
4.  In what ways might we be guilty of neglecting "justice, mercy, and faithfulness" today, even while appearing religious?
5.  How can we "speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves" in our modern context?
6.  What is the connection between "walking humbly with your God" and living a life of justice and mercy?
7.  What are some practical steps our church or community could take to better live out Micah 6:8?
8.  How does the gospel of Jesus Christ empower us to live a life of justice and mercy?
