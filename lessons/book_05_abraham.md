# Father of Faith: A Study of the Life of Abraham

**Category:** Book & Character Study

---

## Introduction

Abraham is one of the most monumental figures in the entire Bible. He is known as the father of the Jewish nation and a spiritual father to all who believe in Jesus Christ. His life story, found in Genesis 12-25, is a sprawling and dramatic epic of faith, failure, promise, and perseverance. It is a story of an ordinary man who was called by an extraordinary God to leave everything he knew and embark on a journey to a land he had never seen.

This study will explore the major events and themes in the life of Abraham. We will see how God called him, the covenant promises God made to him, the tests his faith endured, and the legacy he left behind. Abraham was not a perfect man; his story is marked by moments of doubt, fear, and deception. Yet, through it all, he is remembered as a man of great faith, a man who "believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." His life is a powerful testament to the truth that God can use flawed people to accomplish His glorious purposes.

## Deep Dive Teaching

### The Call and the Covenant (Genesis 12 & 15)

Abram’s story begins in Genesis 12 with a radical call from God: "Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you." This was a call to leave behind every source of security he had—his land, his culture, and his family. In response to this call, God gives Abram a magnificent sevenfold promise:

1.  "I will make you into a great nation..."
2.  "I will bless you..."
3.  "I will make your name great..."
4.  "...and you will be a blessing."
5.  "I will bless those who bless you..."
6.  "...and whoever curses you I will curse..."
7.  "...and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."

This final promise is the most significant; it is a Messianic promise that would ultimately be fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

In Genesis 15, God formalizes this promise in a dramatic covenant ceremony. Abram expresses his doubt—he is old and childless. God reassures him, promising him descendants as numerous as the stars. In response, we find the key verse of Abraham’s life: "Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness" (15:6). Abraham was declared righteous not because of his works, but because of his faith in God’s promise.

### The Failures and the Faithfulness of God (Genesis 12, 16, 20)

Abraham’s journey was not one of perfect faith. On at least two occasions (Genesis 12 and 20), out of fear, he passed off his wife Sarah as his sister, endangering her and showing a lack of trust in God’s protection. The most significant failure was in Genesis 16. After years of waiting for the promised son, Sarah and Abraham took matters into their own hands. Sarah gave her servant, Hagar, to Abraham to produce an heir. This resulted in the birth of Ishmael and brought immense conflict and pain into their family. These stories are included to show us that even the great heroes of the faith were flawed human beings who had to learn to trust God.

### The Fulfillment and the Test (Genesis 21 & 22)

Despite their failures, God remained faithful to His promise. In Genesis 21, when Abraham was 100 and Sarah was 90, Isaac, the long-awaited son of promise, was born. Their laughter of doubt (Genesis 18) was turned into laughter of joy.

Then comes the most difficult and climactic chapter of Abraham’s life: Genesis 22. After years of waiting for Isaac, God gives Abraham an unthinkable command: "Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering." This was the ultimate test of Abraham’s faith. Would he trust God even when God’s command seemed to contradict His promise?

Abraham’s obedience is immediate and resolute. He travels for three days to the mountain, builds the altar, and binds his son. Just as he raises the knife, the angel of the Lord stops him. God provides a ram caught in a thicket to be the substitute sacrifice. Abraham names the place "The LORD Will Provide" (Jehovah-Jireh). Through this agonizing test, Abraham proved that he loved God more than God’s greatest gift. This event is also a stunning foreshadowing of the Gospel, where God the Father would one day provide His own Son, Jesus, as the sacrifice for our sins on that very same mountain range.

### The Legacy

Abraham’s legacy is immense. He is the physical ancestor of the nation of Israel and the spiritual ancestor of all who share his faith in God’s promises. The New Testament repeatedly points to him as the prime example of justification by faith. He is a hero not because he was perfect, but because he trusted God, and God, in His grace, used this flawed man to begin His great plan of redemption for the world.

## Discussion Questions

1.  What did Abraham have to leave behind to obey God’s call? What are some things God might call us to leave behind today?

2.  Genesis 15:6 is a key verse in the Bible. Why is the doctrine of "righteousness by faith" so foundational to Christianity?

3.  Why do you think the Bible includes stories of Abraham’s failures, like lying about Sarah or having a child with Hagar?

4.  Read Genesis 22. Try to imagine what Abraham must have been thinking and feeling during those three days. What does his obedience teach us about the nature of true faith?

5.  How is the story of the offering of Isaac a foreshadowing of the Gospel of Jesus Christ?

6.  Hebrews 11:8 says that Abraham "obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going." How can we cultivate that kind of faith in our own lives?

## Practical Application

1.  **Identify Your "Isaac":** An "Isaac" is a gift from God that we are tempted to love more than God Himself. It could be your family, your career, your reputation, or your financial security. What is the "Isaac" in your life? This week, consciously surrender that thing to God in prayer, acknowledging that He is more precious than His greatest gifts.

2.  **Step Out in Faith:** Is there an area where you know God is calling you to trust Him, but fear is holding you back? Maybe it’s sharing your faith with a friend, stepping into a new ministry, or making a difficult decision. Inspired by Abraham, take one concrete step of obedience this week, even if you don’t know the outcome.

3.  **Trace God’s Faithfulness:** Look back over your life and make a list of the promises God has kept to you. Think about the times He has provided for you, guided you, and been faithful even when you were not. Spend some time thanking Him for His unwavering faithfulness.

## Prayer Focus

*Father of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, you are the great promise-keeper. Thank you for the story of Abraham, a man who shows me what it means to live by faith. I confess that I am often like him, filled with fear and doubt, and I often try to take matters into my own hands. Forgive me. Help me to believe your promises, even when they seem impossible. Give me the courage to obey your call, even when I don’t know where I am going. Help me to hold loosely to your gifts and to hold tightly to you, the Giver. Like Abraham, may it be said of me that I believed God. In the name of Jesus, my Messiah and the ultimate fulfillment of your promise, Amen.*
