# Developing Self-Control: A Study of the Fruit of the Spirit

**Category:** Topical Lesson

---

## Introduction

Self-control is a vital but often overlooked aspect of the Christian life. In a culture that promotes instant gratification, indulgence, and following our every impulse, the biblical call to self-control can seem counter-cultural and difficult. Yet, it is essential for spiritual maturity, healthy relationships, and effective ministry. Lack of self-control can lead to addiction, broken relationships, financial ruin, and a compromised witness for Christ.

This lesson explores the biblical concept of self-control, not as a product of sheer willpower, but as a fruit of the Holy Spirit. We will examine Galatians 5 to understand that true, lasting self-control is not something we achieve on our own, but something that God produces in us as we surrender to His Spirit. We will also look at practical wisdom from Proverbs and the New Testament to learn how we can cooperate with the Spirit in developing this crucial virtue.

## Key Scripture Passages

1.  **Galatians 5:22-25 (NIV):** "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit."

2.  **2 Peter 1:5-7 (NIV):** "For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love."

3.  **Proverbs 25:28 (NIV):** "Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control."

4.  **1 Corinthians 9:25-27 (NIV):** "Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air. No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."

5.  **Titus 2:11-12 (NIV):** "For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say ‘No’ to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age."

6.  **James 1:19 (NIV):** "My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry."

## Deep Dive Teaching

### Self-Control is a Fruit of the Spirit

The most important truth about self-control is found in Galatians 5:22-23. It is listed as the final aspect of the "fruit of the Spirit." This is significant. It is not a "work of the flesh" or a product of our own striving. True, godly self-control is a supernatural result of the Holy Spirit working within us. This doesn't mean we are passive; it means our efforts are empowered by and in cooperation with the Spirit.

Galatians 5:24-25 tells us how this works. We have "crucified the flesh with its passions and desires." This is a decisive act of surrender to Christ. Then, we must "keep in step with the Spirit" on a daily basis. This means actively listening to the Spirit's guidance, obeying His promptings, and relying on His power to say "No" to the flesh.

### The Necessity of Self-Control

Proverbs 25:28 gives a powerful image of a person who lacks self-control: they are like a "city whose walls are broken through." In ancient times, a city's walls were its primary defense against enemy attack. A city without walls was vulnerable, defenseless, and open to plunder and destruction. In the same way, a person without self-control is defenseless against temptation, emotional outbursts, and foolish decisions. They are vulnerable to being overtaken by sin and chaos.

### The Role of Discipline and Effort

While self-control is a fruit of the Spirit, the Bible also calls us to discipline and effort. 2 Peter 1:5-6 instructs us to "make every effort to add... to knowledge, self-control." The Apostle Paul, in 1 Corinthians 9, compares the Christian life to the strict training of an athlete. He says, "I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave." This is not a contradiction, but a partnership. The Spirit provides the power, but we provide the cooperation. We must actively choose to train ourselves, to build godly habits, and to discipline our bodies and minds.

Grace itself is a teacher in this process. Titus 2:12 says that the grace of God "teaches us to say ‘No’ to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives." As we grow in our understanding of God's grace, we are increasingly motivated and empowered to live in a way that honors Him.

### Areas for Self-Control

Self-control is needed in every area of life:

-   **Our Tongues:** (James 1:19) Being slow to speak and slow to become angry.
-   **Our Appetites:** (Proverbs 23:2) Practicing moderation in food and drink.
-   **Our Thoughts:** (2 Corinthians 10:5) Taking every thought captive to make it obedient to Christ.
-   **Our Desires:** (Galatians 5:24) Crucifying the passions of the flesh.
-   **Our Time:** (Ephesians 5:16) Making the most of every opportunity.

## Discussion Questions

1.  How does understanding self-control as a "fruit of the Spirit" rather than just willpower change the way you approach it?

2.  Discuss the imagery in Proverbs 25:28 (a city with broken walls). In what ways have you seen a lack of self-control leave someone (or yourself) vulnerable?

3.  Paul uses the analogy of an athlete in strict training (1 Corinthians 9:25-27). What kind of "training" can a Christian do to develop self-control?

4.  Titus 2:12 says that grace teaches us to be self-controlled. This seems counter-intuitive to some who think grace means we can do whatever we want. How does grace actually empower self-control?

5.  Which area of self-control mentioned in the lesson (tongue, appetites, thoughts, desires, time) do you find most challenging? What is one practical step you could take in that area this week?

6.  How can a Christian community or small group help its members grow in self-control?

## Practical Application

1.  **Start Small:** Choose one specific, measurable area where you want to grow in self-control this week. Don't try to change everything at once. For example: "I will not hit the snooze button," or "I will not have a second dessert," or "I will turn off my phone by 10 PM."

2.  **Pray First:** Before you face a situation where you know you will be tempted to lack self-control, take a moment to pray. Ask the Holy Spirit for His power to help you make the right choice. For example, before a difficult conversation, pray, "Spirit, help me to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry."

3.  **Create a Barrier:** Make it harder to give in to temptation. If you struggle with overspending, leave your credit cards at home. If you struggle with wasting time on social media, use an app to block it for certain hours. If you struggle with unhealthy snacking, don't keep junk food in the house. This is a practical way to "strike a blow" to your body.

## Prayer Focus

*Holy Spirit, I thank you that you are the source of true self-control. I confess that I have often tried to live in my own strength and have failed. I surrender my will, my desires, and my passions to you. Please produce your fruit in my life. Today, I specifically ask for your help in the area of [mention your specific struggle]. Empower me to say "No" to the flesh and "Yes" to you. Help me to keep in step with you, to discipline myself, and to live a life that is pleasing to the Father. In Jesus' name, Amen.*
