# Instruments of Grace: A Study on the Spiritual Disciplines

**Category:** Life-Application Study

---

## Introduction

Spiritual growth is not automatic. While our salvation is a free gift of God’s grace, our sanctification—the process of becoming more like Christ—requires our active participation. The Bible calls us to "work out your salvation with fear and trembling" (Philippians 2:12). This does not mean we work *for* our salvation, but that we work *out* what God has worked *in* us. The primary way we do this is through the practice of the spiritual disciplines.

Spiritual disciplines are not a list of rules to earn God’s favor. Rather, they are habits of grace, time-tested practices that the people of God have used for centuries to place themselves before God so that He can transform them. They are like a trellis that we build for the vine of our spiritual life to grow on. They are the channels through which the Holy Spirit works to shape our character and deepen our relationship with God. This study will explore some of the key spiritual disciplines, both personal and corporate, and provide practical steps for incorporating them into our lives.

## Deep Dive Teaching

### The Purpose of the Disciplines

The goal of the spiritual disciplines is not the disciplines themselves. The goal is godliness. The goal is the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. The disciplines are simply the means to that end. As Dallas Willard famously said, "The disciplines are activities of mind and body purposefully undertaken, to bring our personality and total being into effective cooperation with the divine order." They are how we create space in our lives for the Holy Spirit to do His transformative work.

Paul uses the analogy of an athlete in training. An athlete doesn’t win a race by just wanting to. They discipline their body, their diet, and their schedule for the sake of the prize. In the same way, we are called to discipline ourselves for the purpose of godliness. It requires intentionality, effort, and perseverance.

### Personal Disciplines (The Disciplines of Abstinence and Engagement)

We can group the personal disciplines into two categories:

1.  **Disciplines of Abstinence:** These are disciplines where we abstain from something to free ourselves from its control and make space for God. Examples include:
    *   **Fasting:** Voluntarily abstaining from food (or something else, like media) for a spiritual purpose. Fasting helps to break the power of our physical appetites and heightens our spiritual sensitivity.
    *   **Solitude and Silence:** Intentionally withdrawing from noise and people to be alone with God. In a world of constant distraction, solitude and silence are essential for hearing God’s voice and resting in His presence.
    *   **Simplicity:** Intentionally reducing our consumption and possessions to free ourselves from the grip of materialism and cultivate a spirit of contentment and generosity.

2.  **Disciplines of Engagement:** These are disciplines where we actively engage in a practice to connect with God. Examples include:
    *   **Study and Meditation:** While Bible reading is about getting through the text, study is about the text getting through us. Meditation involves dwelling deeply on a passage of Scripture, pondering its meaning, and listening for God’s voice. As Psalm 1 says, the one who meditates on God’s law is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season.
    *   **Prayer:** As we explored in a previous study, prayer is our vital communication with God.
    *   **Worship:** While often associated with corporate singing, worship is a personal discipline of ascribing worth to God through our thoughts, words, and actions, both in private and in public.

### Corporate Disciplines

Spiritual growth is not just a personal project; it is a community project. The New Testament assumes that we will practice our faith in the context of the local church. Acts 2:42 gives us a beautiful picture of the early church’s corporate disciplines:

-   **The Apostles’ Teaching:** Submitting ourselves to the regular, systematic teaching of God’s Word.
-   **Fellowship (Koinonia):** Sharing life together in authentic, supportive, and accountable community.
-   **The Breaking of Bread:** Regularly participating in the Lord’s Supper (Communion) to remember Christ’s sacrifice.
-   **The Prayers:** Praying together as a body of believers.

Other corporate disciplines include corporate worship, serving one another, and confession of sins to one another.

## Discussion Questions

1.  What is the difference between practicing spiritual disciplines to earn God’s favor versus practicing them to train for godliness?

2.  Which spiritual discipline do you find most intimidating or challenging? Why?

3.  In our noisy, 24/7 connected world, why are the disciplines of solitude and silence so important, yet so difficult?

4.  How can the practice of fasting help in our spiritual lives?

5.  The early church was *devoted* to the corporate disciplines. What does that word "devoted" suggest about their attitude and commitment?

6.  Why is it impossible to be a healthy, growing Christian apart from the community of a local church?

## Practical Application

1.  **Try a Media Fast:** Choose one day this week (or even just a few hours) to fast from all forms of media—social media, news, television, etc. Use the time you would have spent consuming media to pray, read Scripture, or simply be still before God. Journal about your experience.

2.  **Practice Lectio Divina:** *Lectio Divina* (Latin for "divine reading") is an ancient method of meditating on Scripture. Choose a short passage (e.g., Psalm 23:1-3) and follow these four steps:
    *   **Read (Lectio):** Read the passage slowly and carefully several times.
    *   **Meditate (Meditatio):** Read it again and ponder it. Is there a word or phrase that stands out to you? Why?
    *   **Pray (Oratio):** Respond to the passage in prayer. Talk to God about what you have read and what it stirs in your heart.
    *   **Contemplate (Contemplatio):** Rest in God’s presence. Simply be with Him, allowing His truth to sink deep into your soul.

3.  **Engage in a Corporate Discipline:** Don’t just attend church this Sunday; actively engage. Prepare your heart before you go. Sing with intention. Listen to the sermon with a pen and notebook, ready to learn. Look for someone to encourage. Participate fully in the life of the body.

## Prayer Focus

*Father, thank you that you have not left me to struggle in my spiritual life alone. Thank you for the gift of the spiritual disciplines, the instruments of grace you have given me to grow closer to you. Forgive me for my laziness and my lack of intentionality. I ask for the grace and the desire to train myself for godliness. Holy Spirit, work in me as I place myself before you. Shape me and mold me into the image of your Son, Jesus, in whose name I pray. Amen.*
