# Running from God's Call: A Study of the Book of Jonah

**Category:** Book & Character Study

---

## Introduction

The book of Jonah is one of the most well-known stories in the Old Testament, yet it is often misunderstood. It is more than just a children's story about a man being swallowed by a big fish. It is a profound and ironic narrative about a reluctant prophet, a pursuing God, and the surprising breadth of divine compassion. The book is less about the fish and more about the heart—the rebellious heart of Jonah and the merciful heart of God.

This study will take you through the four short chapters of Jonah's story. We will see a prophet who runs in the opposite direction of God's call, a God who pursues him with a storm and a great fish, a pagan city that repents at the preaching of a resentful messenger, and a God who has to teach His own prophet a lesson about mercy. Jonah's story serves as a powerful mirror, forcing us to examine our own prejudices, our own obedience, and our own willingness to embrace God's heart for the lost.

## Deep Dive Teaching

### Chapter 1: The Flight of the Prophet

The story begins with a clear command from God to His prophet, Jonah: "Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me." Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, a brutal and pagan empire and one of Israel's most feared enemies. God's call was a missionary call to a hostile nation.

Jonah's response is immediate and defiant: "But Jonah ran away from the LORD and headed for Tarshish." Tarshish was in the opposite direction, likely in modern-day Spain, the farthest known point in the western Mediterranean. Jonah was not just disobeying; he was trying to get as far away from God's presence as possible.

But you cannot run from a sovereign God. The Lord hurls a great storm at the ship. The pagan sailors are terrified, and through the casting of lots, they identify Jonah as the cause. Jonah admits his guilt and, in a surprising moment of self-sacrifice, tells them to throw him overboard to save themselves. The storm ceases, the sailors offer sacrifices to Jonah's God, and the Lord provides a great fish to swallow Jonah, saving him from drowning.

### Chapter 2: The Prayer from the Deep

Chapter 2 is a beautiful psalm of thanksgiving prayed by Jonah from inside the fish. It is filled with quotes and allusions to the Psalms. Jonah recounts his experience of drowning and acknowledges that God has brought his life up from the pit. He declares, "Salvation comes from the LORD." The prayer ends with a vow to fulfill his commission. In response, "the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land."

### Chapter 3: The Repentance of the City

God gives Jonah a second chance, repeating the exact same command as in Chapter 1. This time, Jonah obeys. He goes to Nineveh and delivers what might be the shortest and least enthusiastic sermon ever recorded: "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown." It is a message of pure judgment, with no mention of mercy or a way to repent.

Incredibly, the people of Nineveh believe God. From the king down to the lowest person, they declare a fast, put on sackcloth, and sit in the dust as signs of repentance. The king issues a decree calling everyone to "give up their evil ways and their violence." When God sees their genuine repentance, He has compassion and does not bring about the destruction He had threatened.

### Chapter 4: The Anger of the Prophet

The story takes its most surprising turn in the final chapter. Instead of rejoicing at the greatest revival in history, Jonah is angry. He is angry because he knew this would happen. He tells God, "Isn't this what I said, LORD, when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity" (4:2). Jonah's problem was not that he was afraid of the Ninevites; his problem was that he was afraid God would be merciful to them. He wanted his enemies to be judged, not forgiven.

In his anger, Jonah goes out of the city to pout. God then provides an object lesson. He makes a leafy plant grow to give Jonah shade, and Jonah is happy about the plant. The next day, God sends a worm to kill the plant and a scorching east wind. Jonah is angry enough to die over the death of the plant.

God then delivers the final, piercing question of the book: "You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight. And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?" (4:10-11). The book ends with this question hanging in the air, forcing Jonah—and the reader—to confront the vast difference between our small, selfish concerns and God's great, compassionate heart for all people.

## Discussion Questions

1.  Why do you think Jonah ran from God's call? Have you ever tried to run from something you knew God was calling you to do?

2.  Jonah's prayer in Chapter 2 is a psalm of thanksgiving, not a prayer of repentance. What does this tell us about his heart at that point?

3.  The Ninevites repented at a very simple message of judgment. Why do you think they were so receptive?

4.  Jonah's anger in Chapter 4 is the climax of the story. Why was he so angry that God showed mercy to his enemies? Do we ever have a similar attitude towards certain people or groups?

5.  What is the point of God's object lesson with the plant, the worm, and the wind?

6.  The book ends with a question from God. What is the effect of this ending? How does God's final question challenge you personally?

## Practical Application

1.  **Identify Your Nineveh:** Is there a person, a group of people, or a place that you have written off as being beyond God's grace? A political party, a rival company, a difficult family member? This week, make a conscious effort to pray for them, asking God to give you His heart of compassion for them.

2.  **Embrace the Second Chance:** Jonah's story is a powerful reminder that God is a God of second chances. Is there an area of your life where you have failed or disobeyed? Take it to God, confess it, and receive His grace to start again. He is not finished with you.

3.  **Check Your Heart for a "Jonah Attitude":** Pay attention to your reactions this week. When you hear about a rival or someone you dislike experiencing trouble, is your secret reaction one of satisfaction? When you see someone receive grace they don't deserve, do you feel a twinge of resentment? Ask God to expose any "Jonah attitudes" in your heart and to replace them with His mercy.

## Prayer Focus

*Gracious and Compassionate God, forgive me for the times I have been like Jonah. Forgive me for running from your call, for my prejudice against those who are different from me, and for my anger when you show mercy to those I think don't deserve it. Shatter my small and selfish heart, and give me a heart that beats with yours—a heart of compassion for the lost. Help me to see all people as you see them, as precious souls in need of your grace. Use me as your messenger of that grace, to my neighbors and to the nations. In Jesus' name, Amen.*
