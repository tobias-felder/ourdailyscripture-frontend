# The Power of Forgiveness: A Study of Matthew 18:21-35

**Category:** Topical Lesson

---

## Introduction

Forgiveness is one of the most central and challenging themes in the Christian faith. It is at the heart of the Gospel—we are saved because God, in His great love, chose to forgive us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Yet, extending that same forgiveness to others who have wronged us can be one of the most difficult things we are ever called to do.

Unforgiveness is a heavy burden. It can lead to bitterness, resentment, anger, and spiritual stagnation. It damages our relationships, our emotional health, and, most importantly, our relationship with God. This lesson explores the profound power of forgiveness through the Parable of the Unmerciful Servant in Matthew 18. Through this powerful story, Jesus illustrates the immense debt of sin that God has forgiven us and reveals that our forgiveness of others is a direct reflection of our understanding and gratitude for God's grace.

## Deep Dive Teaching

### The Unlimited Nature of Forgiveness (Matthew 18:21-22)

Peter's question to Jesus was a reasonable one by human standards. The rabbinic teaching of the day suggested forgiving someone three times was sufficient. Peter, being generous, offered seven times. Jesus' response—"seventy-seven times" (or "seventy times seven" in some translations)—was not a mathematical formula to be tracked. It was a radical statement about the nature of forgiveness: it should be limitless, continuous, and unconditional, just like God's forgiveness of us.

### The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant (Matthew 18:23-35)

To illustrate this point, Jesus tells a powerful parable:

-   **The Immense Debt:** A servant owes a king 10,000 talents. A talent was a unit of weight, often of gold or silver, and 10,000 talents represented an astronomical, unpayable amount—likely billions of dollars in today's terms. This debt represents our sin before a holy God. It is a debt we could never repay on our own.

-   **The King's Mercy:** The servant begs for mercy, and the king, moved with compassion, cancels the entire debt. He doesn't set up a payment plan; he completely erases it. This is a picture of the Gospel. God, in His mercy, has canceled our immeasurable sin debt through Christ.

-   **The Servant's Unforgiveness:** The forgiven servant then goes out and finds a fellow servant who owes him 100 denarii. A denarius was a day's wage. This was a manageable, repayable debt, yet the forgiven servant refuses to show mercy. He has his fellow servant thrown into prison.

-   **The King's Judgment:** When the king hears of this, he is furious. He calls the servant wicked and hands him over to be tortured until he can pay back the original, unpayable debt. Jesus concludes with a sobering warning: "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart" (v. 35).

### The Core Message

The parable's message is clear: our willingness and ability to forgive others flows directly from our grasp of how much God has forgiven us. When we truly understand the magnitude of our sin and the infinite grace of God that has covered it, withholding forgiveness from others becomes unthinkable. Unforgiveness is, in essence, telling God that His grace was sufficient for us, but the offense someone committed against us is too great for that same grace to cover.

Ephesians 4:32 and Colossians 3:13 provide the foundation for our forgiveness of others: "Forgive as the Lord forgave you." Our forgiveness is not based on whether the other person deserves it, whether they have apologized, or whether they will change. It is based on the fact that we, who were undeserving, have been forgiven an infinitely greater debt.

## Discussion Questions

1.  Why do you think Jesus responded to Peter's question with a number ("seventy-seven times") instead of just saying "always"?

2.  In the parable, the first servant's debt was unpayable, while the second servant's debt was relatively small. How does this contrast help us understand our own sin in comparison to the offenses we hold against others?

3.  Have you ever felt like the unmerciful servant, having received God's grace but struggling to show grace to someone else? What was that experience like?

4.  Discuss Matthew 6:14-15. Do you think this means our salvation is dependent on our forgiving others? Or is our forgiveness of others evidence that we have truly received God's forgiveness? Explain your reasoning.

5.  What is the difference between forgiveness and reconciliation? Is it always possible to reconcile with someone who has hurt you? Is it always necessary to forgive?

6.  How did Jesus model forgiveness on the cross (Luke 23:34)? What can we learn from His example, especially when forgiving those who are not sorry for what they have done?

## Practical Application

1.  **The Forgiveness List:** Prayerfully ask God to reveal if there is anyone you are holding unforgiveness against. Write their names down on a piece of paper. Spend time in prayer, and for each name, say aloud, "Because God has forgiven me in Christ, I choose to forgive [Name] for [the offense]." This is not about feelings; it is an act of the will. Afterward, you can destroy the list as a symbol of releasing the debt.

2.  **Grace Goggles:** For the next week, consciously try to view everyone you interact with through the "goggles of grace." Remind yourself that just as you are a recipient of God's unmerited favor, so are they. This is especially important when dealing with difficult people.

3.  **Reflect on Your Debt:** Spend some dedicated time reflecting on the state you were in before Christ and the magnitude of the grace God has shown you. Read passages like Romans 3:23-24 and Ephesians 2:1-10. Let a deep sense of gratitude well up in your heart, as this is the fuel for forgiving others.

## Prayer Focus

*Father in Heaven, I am overwhelmed by the depth of your love and the richness of your mercy. Thank you for forgiving my immeasurable sin debt through the sacrifice of your Son, Jesus. I confess that my heart is often hard, and I struggle to forgive others as you have forgiven me. Please soften my heart and help me to see others through your eyes. Today, I choose to release [Name] from the debt I feel they owe me. I release them to you. Heal my heart from the bitterness and resentment I have been holding onto. Fill me with your love and compassion, so that I can be a conduit of your grace to the world. In Jesus' name, Amen.*
