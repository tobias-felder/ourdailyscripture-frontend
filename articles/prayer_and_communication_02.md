## Commentary & Insight

James 5:16 reveals a powerful truth about prayer: "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." This verse is not about being perfect, but about being in right relationship with God. A righteous person is someone who has been made right with God through faith in Jesus Christ and who seeks to live in obedience to His commands. This verse also highlights the importance of confession and community in our prayer lives. When we confess our sins to one another and pray for one another, we create an environment of humility, transparency, and mutual support. This is the context in which powerful and effective prayer takes place. The prayer of a righteous person is not powerful because of the person who is praying, but because of the God who is hearing and answering the prayer. It is a prayer that is aligned with God's will, empowered by His Spirit, and offered in faith.
