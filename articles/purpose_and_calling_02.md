_# The Great Commission: Our Shared Purpose

## Introduction

While each of us has a unique calling and purpose, we also share a common mission as followers of Christ. This mission is known as the Great Commission, and it is the central task of the church. This article explores the meaning of the Great Commission and how we can all participate in it.

## Key Scripture

> "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." - Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)

## Commentary & Insight

In these final words to His disciples, Jesus gives them a clear and compelling mission: to "go and make disciples of all nations." This is not a suggestion, but a command. It is the primary task of the church and the shared purpose of every believer. The Great Commission involves three key activities: going, baptizing, and teaching. "Going" means that we are to be proactive in sharing the gospel with those who do not yet know Christ. "Baptizing" is a public declaration of faith and a symbol of new life in Christ. "Teaching" involves helping new believers to grow in their faith and to live in obedience to God's commands. This is a monumental task, but we are not alone in it. Jesus promises to be with us "always, to the very end of the age." His presence is our power, our comfort, and our hope as we seek to fulfill His commission.
