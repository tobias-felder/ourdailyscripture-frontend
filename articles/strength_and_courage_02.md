_# The Source of True Courage

## Introduction

Courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to act in spite of it. It is a quality that is essential for navigating the challenges of life and for living a life that is pleasing to God. This article explores the source of true courage and how we can cultivate it in our lives.

## Key Scripture

> "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go." - Joshua 1:9 (NIV)

## Commentary & Insight

In this powerful verse, God speaks to Joshua as he is about to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. It is a moment of great transition and uncertainty, and Joshua is understandably fearful. But God does not rebuke him for his fear. Instead, He gives him a command and a promise. The command is to "be strong and courageous." The promise is that "the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go." This is the source of true courage: the presence of God. Our courage is not based on our own strength or abilities, but on the fact that the all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving God is with us. He is our constant companion, our ever-present help in times of trouble. When we are rooted in this truth, we can face any challenge with confidence and courage.
