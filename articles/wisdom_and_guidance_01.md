## Commentary & Insight

James 1:5 provides a clear and simple path to obtaining wisdom: ask God. This is a profound and humbling truth. We do not have to rely on our own understanding or the wisdom of the world. We can go directly to the source of all wisdom and He will give it to us generously. This verse also reveals the character of God. He is a giving God who delights in providing for His children. He does not find fault with our lack of wisdom, but rather invites us to come to Him with our needs. The wisdom that God gives is not just for making big life decisions, but for navigating the everyday challenges and opportunities of life. It is a practical wisdom that enables us to live with skill and discernment. To receive this wisdom, we must approach God with a humble and teachable heart, ready to receive His guidance and to walk in His ways.
