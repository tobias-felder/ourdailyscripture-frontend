_# Living a Life of Purpose and Calling

## Introduction

Every human heart longs for a sense of purpose. We want to know that our lives matter, that we are making a difference in the world. The Bible teaches that we were created by God with a unique purpose and calling. This article explores how we can discover and live out that calling.

## Key Scripture

> "For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." - Ephesians 2:10 (NIV)

## Commentary & Insight

Ephesians 2:10 is a beautiful reminder that we are not cosmic accidents, but masterpieces created by God. The word "handiwork" in the original Greek is "poiema," from which we get our English word "poem." We are God's poetry, His works of art, created with intention and purpose. This verse tells us that we were created "in Christ Jesus to do good works." This is our calling, our purpose. These good works are not a means of salvation, but the fruit of our salvation. They are the good works that God has "prepared in advance for us to do." This means that our purpose is not something we have to invent, but something we have to discover. It is a path that God has already laid out for us. To discover this path, we must cultivate a close relationship with God, seek His guidance in prayer, and use the gifts and talents He has given us to serve others.
